->What are Parameterized API Calls in Node.js?
    Parameterized API calls allow you to pass dynamic values (parameters) in the URL, so the server can
    respond based on the data provided.
    This is especially useful when dealing with user-specific or item-specific requests (like fetching a user by ID).

(Important):
->Now if someone told you to give a list of people who are only waiters
  Then we can create an endpoint like this:
    ● /person/chef
    ● /person/waiter
    ● /person/manager

Note:But this is not the correct method to create as many functions/endpoints Here we can use parametrized endpoints
    i.e parametrized url - means passing parameters in url
 ->It can be dynamically inserted into the URL when making a request to the API.
    localhost:3000/person/:work
    → work = [ “chef”, “waiter”, “manager” ]

app.get('/person/:work', async (req, res) => {
 try {
   const workType = req.params.work; // Extract the work type from the URL parameter
    // Assuming you already have a Person model and MongoDB connection set up
    const persons = await Person.find({ work: workType });
    // Send the list of persons with the specified work type as a JSON response
    res.json(persons);
    } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching persons:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
 }
});
