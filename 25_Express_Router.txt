//Important

From Now onwords myServer.js file will not be used we will be using myNewServer.js

● We have lots of Endpoints in a single file server.js or myServer.js
● This makes bad experience in code readability as well as code handling
● Express Router is a way to modularize and organize your route handling code in an Express.js application.
● So let’s create a separate file to manage endpoints /person and /menu
● Express Router is like a traffic cop for your web server
● Express Router helps you organize and manage these pages or endpoints in your web application. It's like creating separate folders 
  for different types of tasks.

->Creating new folder called "Routes"
    -And inside this Routes folder i will add file example: personRoutes.js, etc...
     (now check personRoutes.js file)

     And using it inside myNewServer.js file like this
     const personRoutes=require('./Routes/personRoutes')
      app.use('/person',personRoutes)//using the router
