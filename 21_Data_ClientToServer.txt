//Important:
->SendData from Client to Server:
    > We need an Endpoint where the client sends data and that data needs to be saved in the database
    > So client will send/request the data to/from the server and server will save/get the data from database
        Client <---------> Server <-----------> Database

    >We need a method called POST
     -Now code the POST method to add the person
     -If we send the random values as well Mongoose will not save random values other than predefined schem
