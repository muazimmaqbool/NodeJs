What is Middleware in Node.js?

  Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request (req), response (res), and the next() function 
  in an Express application.

  -> In simple words middleware is like a phase in which many functions execute and whenever all these functions gets executed
      then the response of the request is given back to the user by the server

  Example:
    Imagine you're at restaurant and you've placed an order. Now before the order/food reaches your tables, it goes through
    several stages in the kitchen. Each stage involves different tasks, like chopping vegetables, cooking and adding spices.
    Middleware is a bit like these stages in the kitchen, it's something that happens in between your request and the final
    response in a web application
                       _______________
                      |               |
    ----Request------>|     API       |------Response---->
                      | (Middleware)  |
                      |_______________|

  -> Let's say we want to log every request which is made to our node application:
      Step 1: inside server file here it's myNewServer.js file create a middleware function


  Note: logging means that at which time and date which user enters or you can hit the particular endpoint/ website
        generally its called log request in companies, usually logging is done in every big product and it's an important feature
