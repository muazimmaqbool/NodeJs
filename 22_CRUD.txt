->What is CRUD?
  CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete â€” the four basic operations that can be performed on data in most 
  applications, especially in databases and RESTful APIs.

  ->A RESTful API is a way for two systems (like a frontend and a backend) to communicate over the internet using simple rules.
    REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
    It uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations on data.

->Breakdown of CRUD Operations:
  1)Create:
    Adds new data to the database.
    Example: Adding a new user to a user list.

  2)Read:
    Retrieves or displays data from the database.
    Example: Viewing a user's profile or listing all users.

  3)Update:
    Modifies existing data.
    Example: Changing a user's email or password.

  4)Delete:
    Removes data from the database.
    Example: Deleting a user account.

->Where is CRUD used?
    CRUD is used in:
    Backend development (APIs)
    Frontend apps (UI buttons triggering CRUD actions)
    Databases (SQL commands or NoSQL queries)
    Admin panels and dashboards

->Example (User App):
Operation	HTTP Method	    Example URL	               Description
---------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------
Create	     POST	          /users	            Add a new user
Read	     GET	          /users or /users/1	Get users or a specific user
Update	    PUT/PATCH	      /users/1	            Update user with ID 1
Delete	    DELETE	          /users/1	            Delete user with ID 1

->Difference between PUT and PATCH:
    PUT replaces the entire resource with new data.
    PATCH updates only specific fields of the resource.
