➡️Update Operation In Node.js:
    ->We will update our person Records, and for that, we will create an endpoint from where we are able to update the record
    ->For Updation, we need two things
        1️⃣ Which record we want to update?
        2️⃣ What exactly do we want to update?
    🟢For update, we will use the PUT method to create an endpoint
        Note: We can also use PATCH method to update the data but for now we will use PUT method
    🟢What is a unique identifier in a document in a collection?
    🟢It’s _id which Mongodb itself gives, We will use this to find the particularrecord that we want to update
    🟢Just like in POST method we give the data here for updating the data we also have to give the data which is basically new data i.e updated
