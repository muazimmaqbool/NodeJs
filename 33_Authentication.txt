Authentication implementation in Node.js:
    1) Authentication Middleware:
        -In your node.js application, you might use middleware like "Passport.js" to handle the authentication process.
        -Passport helps verify the identity via provided credentials (Passport is a thirdparty middleware)
    
    2) User Roles and Permissions:
        -You'll define roles for staff memebers(e.g: chef, waiter, manager)
        -Authentication middleware will check the role of the authenticated user and grant access accordionly
    
    3)Secure Endpoints:
        - You'll need protect certain routes(like updating menu items) with authentication checks.
        - Her in my project, only authenticated and authorixe users(like managers/chefs) will be allowed to access these routes

->Important and Passport.js :
    ➡️ we will implement Authentication as a middleware function. So that, Routes will be authenticated before reaching out to the server
    ➡️ implementing authentication as a middleware function is a comman and effective approach
    ➡️ Passport.js - popular authentication middleware for Node.js, it is a powerful tool which helps developers to handle
        user authentication in node.js.
        🟢 Strategy: Passport.js uses the concept of strategies for handling different authentication methods.
                     A Strategy is a way of authenticating users, Passport.js comes with various builtin strategies
                     You can also create custom strategies
        🟢 Serialize and Deserialize: Serialization is the process of converting user data intro a format that can be stored, usually
                a unique identifier, Deserialization is the reverse process of converting that unique indefier back to the user data.
                Serialization and Deserialization is usuallyused with sesssions 
    ➡️ To install: npm install passport install passport-local (to use local strategy)
        -> local strategy is basically username and password strategy


➡️ Code in myNewServer.js file

  ➡️ we will be adding username and password in person schema
