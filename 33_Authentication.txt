Authentication implementation in Node.js:
    1) Authentication Middleware:
        -In your node.js application, you might use middleware like "Passport.js" to handle the authentication process.
        -Passport helps verify the identity via provided credentials
    
    2) User Roles and Permissions:
        -You'll define roles for staff memebers(e.g: chef, waiter, manager)
        -Authentication middleware will check the role of the authenticated user and grant access accordionly
    
    3)Secure Endpoints:
        - You'll need protect certain routes(like updating menu items) with authentication checks.
        - Her in my project, only authenticated and authorixe users(like managers/chefs) will be allowed to access these routes
