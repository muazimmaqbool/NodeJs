//First check previous code 36 and 37:

➡️ JWT Functions:
    In the context of the JWT, jwt.sign() and jwt.veryify() are the two important functions provided by 'jsonwebtoken' library in Node.js
     ➡️ jwt.sign() : used to generate a new JWT token based on the payload and options provided.
                      It takes three parameters: payload, secret or private key (secret key used to sign the token),
                                                 options(optional)-> example which algorithm we are using, expiry time etc
     
     ➡️ jwt.veryify() : used to veryify and decode a JWT token to retrieve the orginal payload.
                        It takes three parameters: token, secret or private key,
                                                   options (optional) -> adding addional options for verifications such as: algorithms, audience, issuer and more

     Note: By default the JWT token don't have a expiry time.
    Here are the main “functions” or actions around JSON Web Tokens:
    🔹1. Create / Sign a JWT:
        Server takes a header + payload + secret key and signs them with an algorithm (e.g. HS256).
        This produces the header.payload.signature string.
        Libraries usually call this sign() or encode().
        Example (Node.js): jwt.sign(payload, secret, options)

    🔹2. Send / Store the JWT:
        Server sends the JWT to the client after login.
        Client stores it (in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookie).
        Client sends it back in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header on each request.

    🔹3. Verify a JWT:
        Server checks the token’s signature to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with.
        Also checks expiry (exp claim).
        Libraries call this verify() or decodeAndVerify().
        Example (Node.js): jwt.verify(token, secret)

    🔹4. Decode a JWT:
        View the token’s contents (header + payload) without verifying signature.
        Useful for debugging.
        Libraries call this decode().
        Example: jwt.decode(token)

    🔹5. Refresh / Reissue Tokens:
        If the JWT is about to expire, issue a new token using a refresh token or re-login.
