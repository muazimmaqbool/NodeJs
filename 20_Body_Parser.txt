->What is body parser?

    ->install body parser: npm i body-parser

 ● bodyParser is a middleware library for Express.js.
    -> middleware refers to software or functions that sit in the middle between the request from a client (like a browser or mobile app) 
       and the response from the server. It intercepts, processes, or modifies the request or response before passing it on

 ● It is used to parse and extract the body of incoming HTTP requests.

 ● When a client (e.g., a web browser or a mobile app) sends data to a server,
   it typically includes that data in the body of an HTTP request.

 ● This data can be in various formats, such as JSON, form data, or
   URL-encoded data. bodyParser helps parse and extract this data from
   the request so that you can work with it in your Express.js application.

 ● bodyParser processes the request body before it reaches your route
   handlers, making the parsed data available in the req.body for further
   processing

 ● bodyParser.json() automatically parses the JSON data from the
   request body and converts it into a JavaScript object, which is then stored
   in the req.body

 ● Express.js uses lots of middleware and to use middleware we use the app.use():
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    app.use(bodyParser.json())

 ->Body parser is a middleware that helps your backend server read and parse the body of incoming HTTP requests, 
  especially POST and PUT requests — where data is sent from the client (like a form or JSON)
