俱뫮잺 Dotenv:
  游릭 The dotenv module in Node.js is used to manage configuration variables and sensitive information in your applications.
  游릭 It's particularly useful for keeping sensitive data like API keys, database connection strings, database username and password, and other 
     environment-specific configurations separate from your code.
  游릭 To install dotenv: npm install dotenv
        俱뫮잺 Create a .env File
        俱뫮잺 This is where you'll store your environment-specific configuration variables.
        俱뫮잺 format VAR_NAME=value.

    俱뫮잺Inside this .env file you can add your sensitive information like username, password, api key, port
        example: PORT=3000, etc..
       
       游릭 Now use this .env file in server file here we have myNewServer.js like this:
            require("dotenv").config(); on top,
            - it means now server kows that we have .env file

        游릭 Now using PORT variable of .env file inside myNewServer.js file:
            const PORT=process.env.PORT
                app.listen(PORT, () => {
                console.log("Server is listening on port 3000");
            });

        俱뫮잺 Note inside which ever file you use the variable from .env file you have to add 
           this line on top first:  require("dotenv").config();
