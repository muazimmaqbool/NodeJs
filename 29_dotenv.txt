➡️ Dotenv:
  🟢 The dotenv module in Node.js is used to manage configuration variables and sensitive information in your applications.
  🟢 It's particularly useful for keeping sensitive data like API keys, database connection strings, database username and password, and other 
     environment-specific configurations separate from your code.
  🟢 To install dotenv: npm install dotenv
        ➡️ Create a .env File
        ➡️ This is where you'll store your environment-specific configuration variables.
        ➡️ format VAR_NAME=value.
