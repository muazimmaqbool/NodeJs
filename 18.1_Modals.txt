->What are models or schema ? 
  - Modal's are like a blueprint of our database
  - It's a representation of a specific collection in MongoDB. Like a persons data
  - Once you have defined a modal, you can create, read, update and delete documnets in the corresponding MongoDB collection
  - Mongoose allow you to define a schema for your documents. A schema is like a blueprint that defines the structure and
    data types of your documents within a collection.
    > Example a person is a collection(bunch of records) and inside this person collection we are inserting a document, so how this 
      document will look is defined via schema.
    > Example person's details
     {
        "name":"abc",
         "address":"abc",
         ...
         ...
         ...
     }
