->What are models or schema ? 
  - Modal's are like a blueprint of our database
  - It's a representation of a specific collection in MongoDB. Like a persons data
  - Once you have defined a modal, you can create, read, update and delete documnets in the corresponding MongoDB collection
  - Mongoose allow you to define a schema for your documents. A schema is like a blueprint that defines the structure and
    data types of your documents within a collection.
    > Example a person is a collection(bunch of records) and inside this person collection we are inserting a document, so how this 
      document will look is defined via schema.
    > Each Person's Detail ( like chef, owner, manager, waiter )
        {
          "name": "Alice",
          "age": 28,
          "work": "Chef",
          "mobile": "123-456-7890",
          "email": "alice@example.com",
          "address": "123 Main St, City",
          "salary": 6000
        }

    > Now we will make blueprint of the data with the help of mongoose:
        Note: To do this we create a folder called modal:
                  >Modal (inside this file for person called preson.js)
                    >person.js
