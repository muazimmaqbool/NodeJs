//JWT token implementation:

➡️ Changes in existing code:
    1️⃣ Signup Route: First we will replace '/' with '/signup' inside personRoutes.js for saving person data via POST request,
        then when we hit this endpoint and will return JWT token after the person registration is successful.
    2️⃣ Login Route: We need a '/login' this route will handle user login and issue a new jwt token upon successful authentication.
    3️⃣ Protected Routes: The routes which have protection/authentication will be accessed only by providing a valid JWT token.
                Right now we have added authentication of localAuthMiddleWare to person route in myNewServer.js file like this:          
                    app.use("/person",localAuthMiddleware, personRoutes);
                    We will replace it, because to access the person routes and its sub routes we need to provide username and password
                    which is complicated and to avoid it we will add jwt authentication to it

➡️ Install jsonwebtoken: npm i jsonwebtoken

➡️ Create JWT Auth middleware (jwtAuthMiddleware):
    This middleware is responsible for authentication via tokens
    1️⃣ new file added jwt.js (here jwt auth middleware logic will be written)
