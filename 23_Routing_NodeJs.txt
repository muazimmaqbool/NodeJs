->Node.js Routing With Express  (checkout notes of day 6)

1️⃣ What is Routing in Node.js?
  -Routing in Node.js refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. It defines how the server handles different 
   HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., for specific paths.
  -In Node.js, especially when using frameworks like Express.js, routing is used to build web applications and APIs by associating URLs with 
   the correct controller logic.
