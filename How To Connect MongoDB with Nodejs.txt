->Connect MongoDB with Node.js:
    - To connect mongodb with Node.js we need a mongodb driver(a set of programs)
    - A mongodb driver is essential when connecting Node.js with mongodb because it acts as a bridge between Node.js application
      and the mongodb database
    - MongoDB speaks its own language(protocol) to interact with the database server
    - Node.js communication in javascript.
    - So, the driver translates the js code from Node.js into format that MongoDB can understand and vice versa.
    - The driver provides a set of functions and methods that make it easier to perform common database operations from your
       Node.js code
    - The driver helps you handle errors that might cause during databse interactions. It provides error codes, descriptions, and other
       details to help you fix issues quickly

    - The most popular driver is the "official mongodb Node.js driver" as known as mongodb package.
      to install > npm install mongodb

    - Note: but we won't be using this, we will be using "Mongoose"

    ->Mongoose:
      - Mongoose is an Object Data Modelling (ODM) library for mongodb and node.js
      - It does the same thing connect node.js and mongodb
      - Why we are using Mongoose?
        1)It makes working with the database smoother and easier (Very less code then mongodb's official driver).
        2)With Mongoose, you can define how your data should look (like making blueprint for your database)
        3)Mongoose helps you to make sure the data you put into the database is correct
        4)Very easy to query from the database
        5)Without Mongoose your code mught get messy and harder to understand
        6
      
       - In short, using Mongoose makes working with mongodb in Node.js much simpler and smoother. It gives you tools that handle complexities
         for you, so you can focus on building your application without getting bogged down in techincal details.
