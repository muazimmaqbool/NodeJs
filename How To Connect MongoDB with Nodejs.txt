->Connect MongoDB with Node.js:
    - To connect mongodb with Node.js we need a mongodb driver (a set of programs)
    - A mongodb driver is essential when connecting Node.js with mongodb because it acts as a bridge between Node.js application
      and the mongodb database
    - MongoDB speaks its own language(protocol) to interact with the database server
    - Node.js communication in javascript.
    - So, the driver translates the js code from Node.js into format that MongoDB can understand and vice versa.
    - The driver provides a set of functions and methods that make it easier to perform common database operations from your
       Node.js code
    - The driver helps you handle errors that might cause during databse interactions. It provides error codes, descriptions, and other
       details to help you fix issues quickly

    - The most popular driver is the "official mongodb Node.js driver" as known as mongodb package.
