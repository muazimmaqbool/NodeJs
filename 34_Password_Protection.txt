->Storing Plain Password in Db is not safe
  If any hacker gets out db then the hacker can easily get our data so saving password as a plan text in db is not
  safe at all.

  ->To enhance security, it's highly recommended to has and salt passwords before storing them.

-> bcrypt library:
    We can use bcrypt library for password hashing in your nodejs application.
    to install it: npm i bcrypt
    ->this library will do encryption and decryption work

    ->what will bcrypt do and how it work:
        this bcrypt library will put your password in an hash function and then return hashed password

         password -------------- hash function ----------- hashed password
