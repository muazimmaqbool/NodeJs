->Storing Plain Password in Db is not safe
  If any hacker gets out db then the hacker can easily get our data so saving password as a plan text in db is not
  safe at all.

->To enhance security, it's highly recommended to 'hash and salt' passwords before storing them in the db.

-> bcrypt library:
    We can use bcrypt library for password hashing in your nodejs application.
    to install it: npm i bcrypt
    ->this library will do encryption and decryption work

    ->what will bcrypt do and how it work:
        this bcrypt library will put your password in an hash function and then return hashed password

         password -------------- hash function ----------- hashed password

            |                         |                          |

    ->We will do this in backend like we have to covert the password to the hashed password before saving it to the 
      database.
    ->Here in our case the mongoose provide a middleware called 'pre' to executes a function (function which hashes password)
      before the save operation.
    ->We will do this in person.js modal (inside Modals folder):
      inside this file we will first > import bycrypt like this: 
      const bycrypt=require("bcrypt")
      then we will write this:
      personSchema.pre("save",async function(next){
        .... //rest code their inside person.js
      })
