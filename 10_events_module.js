/*
Event Module in Node.js:
    ->Node.js has a built-in module, called "Events", where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events.
    ->The event module allows us to work with events in node.js
        {event: its an action or occurrence that has happened in our application that we can respond to}
    ->using Event Module, we can dispatch our own custom events and respoont to those custom events in a non-blocking manner

    Example: Event Module Scenario:
        ->Let's say you are hungry and we can to pizza hut.
        ->At the counter you placed the order for the pizza
        ->The cook in the kitchen starts making your order the moment cook sees your order
        {
        ->Here in this scenario:
            ->the order being placed for pizza is the event
            ->the cook making the pizza is the response to the event
        }
