Session Tokens and Cookies in Nodejs

-> Session:
    A session is a way to maintain user state and authenticate users in web appplication/
                or
    A session is a way for a web server to maintain state and track a user's activity across multiple pages during a single visit to 
    a website. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the foundation of the web, is stateless. This means that each request a 
    user makes is treated as an independent event, with no memory of previous requests. 
    Sessions solve this by providing a "memory" for the server.

    1: User authentication:
        When you login into any web application/website to access certain features. Sessions or tokens are used to authenticate users,
        provig that they are who they claim to be. This makes sure only authorized users can access it or can access certain features.
    
    2: Maintaining user state:
        Web apps often needs to track/know user information as they navigate through different pages etc. Sessions or token help maintain
        the user state also. Example: if you add an item in cart in the shopping website, the website needs to remember those items as you
        browse other pages/websites. Sessions/token store this information so that it can be accessed later.
