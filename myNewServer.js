俱뫮잺 : Important on Middleware
if we don't call next() in middleware function then it won't go to the next part i.e it won't
 show the response i.e will not go to the server, it will stuck in the middleware,
 try after removig next() in logRequest function, you will see time and url in console but now the response in the screen/postman

 ->In Express.js the next() is the callback function that signal to Express.js that the current middleware function has
 completed its processing and it's time to move on to the next middleware function or route handler in the chain

  -> Understanding next() function diagram:
                         (游릭 = represents a middleware function)
                   | All middleware has access to req,res and next |
                   |                                               |
  -----Request---->|  游릭next()->游릭next()->游릭next()->游릭next()->游릭  |--- Response---> 
                   |                                               |
                   |                                               |


  -> Middleware Stack:
    
                   |                                 |
                   |                                 |
  -----Request---->|  游릭 next()->游릭  next()->   游릭  |--- Response--->

        ->If you got to menuRoutes or personRoutes, you can see router their, router is also a third party middleware
        ->Bodyparser is also a middleware
        ->Authentication also
